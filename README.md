# 🐻 Bear Classifier 🐻

Welcome to the Bear Classifier repository! This project contains a powerful classifier that distinguishes between Teddy Bears, Grizzly Bears, and Black Bears. Built using Fastai, this model leverages cutting-edge machine learning techniques for accurate bear identification.

## 🌟 Features
- **Classify Bears:** Accurately identify Teddy Bears, Grizzly Bears, and Black Bears.
- **Interactive Web App:** Run the classifier locally or view a live demo on Gradio.
- **Model Training:** Explore the Jupyter notebook used to train the model.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- **`app.py`**: The main script to run the classifier locally.
- **`bearclassifierwebapp.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook containing the model training code.
- **`example1.jpg`, `example2.jpg`, ...**: Example pictures to test and see the performance of the model.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Running Locally
1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ElieAndre/bear-classifier.git
    cd bear-classifier
    ```

2. **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

4. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:7860` to view the Bear Classifier in action.

### Live Demo
You can also try out the Bear Classifier on Gradio without any setup. [Click here to view the live demo!](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ElieDisso/fastai_bearclassifier) (replace `#` with the actual link)

## 📸 Example Images
Included in the repository are several `.jpg` files. These are example pictures you can use to test the performance of the model.

## 📓 Model Training
The model was trained using the `bearclassifierwebapp.ipynb` notebook. You can explore the notebook to see the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.
